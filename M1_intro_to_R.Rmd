```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
The purpose of this in-class demo is to familiarize you with R, RStudio and R Markdown.

### Basics to know about R

#### Installing R

R: To use R, navigate your browser to https://cran.r-project.org/. Download. You’re ready to use.

RStudio: Most R users interact with R through an (amazing) IDE called “RStudio”. Navigate to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/ and download the desktop IDE. Now you’re really ready.

1. R is free: R is an open source language so you don't need to pay for it.

2. R is an object oriented language and its objects have types. What this means is you can create multiple objects and hold them in memory, e.g., multiple datasets. 

You have to NAME objects and you can assign stuff to each object. 

* a <- 3" (i.e. the object a has been assigned as a scalar — or single-length vector — equal to 3).
* b <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2) (i.e. the object b has been assigned as a 2x2 matrix)

Side note: the <- assignment operator is read aloud as “gets”. You can also use a regular  equal sign if you prefer, e.g. a = 3.
 
### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. To see the output, you can either run the R code line by line in the console, or change "r, eval=FALSE" to "r, eval = TRUE" in the .Rmd file in R for the R code block you want to run and view the output for. 

### Basic R Syntax, data types and objects

#### Data types
##### Numeric
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# eval = FALSE can be changed to eval = TRUE if you want the output to be displayed
# Enter a number, evaluate its class
1
class(1)

# Arithmetic Operators
#   +   addition
#   -   subtraction
#   *   multiplication
#   /   division
#   ^   exponentiation
2+2
2^2
2-2
```

##### Character
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Enter a character in quotes, evaluate its class
"Analytics"
class("Analytics")

```

##### Logical
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Enter a logical value, evaluate its class
TRUE
FALSE
class(TRUE)

1<2

# Logical operators
#   &   for logical AND
#   |   for logical OR
#   !   for logical negation (NOT)
TRUE | FALSE
TRUE & FALSE
!TRUE

# Relational operators: 
#   <   for Less than
#   >   for Greater than
#   <=  for Less than or equal to
#   >=  for Greater than or equal to
#   ==  for Equal to
#   !=  for Not equal to
3 > 9
3 >= 9
3 < 9
3 <= 9
3 == 9
3 != 9
"b" > "a"
```


##### Date-time
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Get current time and date. Evaluate its class. The default format is yyyy-mm-dd

Sys.Date()
Sys.time()

class(Sys.Date())
class(Sys.time())

class("2021-01-01")

# to create a date, use as.Date
as.Date("2021-01-01")
class(as.Date("2021-01-01"))
# to create a date-time, use as.POSIXct
as.POSIXct("2021-01-01 04:20:00")

# extract current month, year, and date from Sys.Date
format(Sys.Date(), "%m")
format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")
format(Sys.Date(), "%d")

# can convert to numeric class
d <- format(Sys.Date(), "%d")
class(d)
d <- as.numeric(d)
class(d)
## Variable assignment
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# assign "hello world" to variable h
x <- "welcome to stats with R"

# autoprinting. you do not need the "print" function.
x

# delete variable
rm(x)
x
```


##### Vectors and lists
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# What do the `list()` and `c()` functions do? You can get help in R by typing a question mark. 
?c

# You can create a list of arbitrary values
y <- list("stats with R", 3, 9, 5)
class(y)
y

# Vectors are a list where all elements have the same type
v <- c(3, 9, 5)
class(v)
v
# Subsetting vectors

# You can select elements in a given positions using positive integers
v[1]

# You can do this for more than one element using c, i.e., concatenate
v[c(1, 3)]

# Negative integers drops the elements in their position
v[c(-1, -3)]

# Logical vectors select elements with a corresponding value of TRUE
v[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]

```
### Reading, writing and subsetting data


#### Data Frames
```{r, eval=FALSE}

# CSV "Comma Separated Values" Format
data <- read.csv("http://www.unnatinarang.com/uploads/1/0/9/8/109864012/data1.csv")

class(data)

# Compactly displays the data structure of the data object.
str(data)

# Viewing (browsing) data
View(data)

# Displays the names of variables contained in the dataObject.
names(data)

# Displays the vector defined by the variable name contained in the dataObject
data[,3]
data[,1:3]

data$location
data$"location"

# table() and summary() summarize values
table(data$test_result)
summary(data$age)

# Display the first few rows
head(data)
data[1:3,]

# Display individuals testing negative
data[data$test_result == "Negative", ]

# Display individuals older than 21
data[data$age > 21, ]

# Display individuals older than 21 & negative
data[data$age > 21 & data$test_result == "Negative", ]

```

### Installing packages and setting working directory
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# To read .xlsx file, we need to install the OPENXLSX package in the following way
install.packages("openxlsx")
library(openxlsx)
data <- read.xlsx("http://www.unnatinarang.com/uploads/1/0/9/8/109864012/data1.xlsx")

# You can also read data locally saved on your computer in 2 ways

# set working directory to wherever the data are stored using # setwd("filepath/") . In my case, it is in a folder called "Data" on the Desktop. Then read the file
# setwd("~/Desktop/Data")
# data <- read.xlsx("data1.xlsx")

# or give the data its file path and name directly in one line of code
# data <- read.xlsx("~/Desktop/Data/data1.xlsx")

# if you do not know the file path, simply save the data in the same folder as this .Rmd file. Then go to "Session --> Set Working Directory --> To Source File Location" to let R do this for you. What do you notice runs in the R console?
```



### Functions
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create function that adds two numbers
multiply <- function(a, b) { 
  a * b
}

# Invoke the function
multiply(a = 3, b = 9)
multiply(3, 9)
multiply()

# Without a and b, the function doens't work. Now redefine function with default values for arguments and try invoking it again.
multiply <- function(a = 0, b = 0) { 
  a + b
}

multiply()

```
### Conditionals and Loops (*advanced topic)

#### Conditional statements (if, if/else)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# If
if (TRUE) {
  print("Condition is TRUE!")
}


# If/Else
if (TRUE) {
  print("Condition is TRUE!")
} else {
  print("Condition is FALSE!")
}

```

#### Loops (for)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (item in v) {
  print(item)
}

# try printing all IDs
for (item in data$Id) {
  print(item)
}

for (item in 1:nrow(data)) {
  print(data$Id[item])
}


```

For additional resources, refer to https://github.com/grantmcdermott and https://tyleransom.github.io/econometricslabs.html.

#### Your turn to try it!

1. Insert an R code chunk below. (What does the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+I do?) 
```{r}

```


2. Try printing all ages from the data.xlsx file you read earlier in R.
data$age

3. Define a variable called "Shows" as a list of 4 of your favorite TV shows. Print out the first show only.

4. Create a function that takes a two numeric values and calculates their average. If the average is greater than the first number, print "Fighting Illini!"
